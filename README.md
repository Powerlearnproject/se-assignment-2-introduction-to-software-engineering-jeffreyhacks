Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: 
Software engineering is a systematic approach to designing, implementing, and maintaining software systems, focusing on producing high-quality, reliable, and efficient software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is a systematic approach to software development that goes beyond mere coding. It involves project planning, requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and ongoing maintenance. Unlike traditional programming, which focuses on individual scripts, software engineering aims to create scalable, adaptable, and well-structured software systems.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
 1. Requirements gathering and analysis;developer work with stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.
 2. system design;developer designs the architecture and structure of the software.
 3. coding;developer writes the code and specification  for the software.
 4. testing;developer performs  tests like unit,integration,system to the software to ensure it meets the requirements and is bug-free.
 5. deployment;developer deploys the software to production.
 6. maintenance;developer maintains  by fixing bugs,updates and enhancement to the software after it has been deployed.
 7. support;developer provides support for user issues the software.
 8. retirement;developer retires the software which involves decommissioning,data archiving and system deactivation.
Software Development Models:

What are the different software development models? What are the key differences between them?
1. The waterfall method follows a linear method 
2. v-model -validation and verification  emphasizes at verification at each stage.
3. incremental and iterative model;developes the system incrementally ie builds in phase.
4. Prototyping method creates a working model quickly and refines based on user feedback.
5. spiral method:focuses on risk assessment and mitigation, it combines waterfall and prototyping.
6. Agile method:   The development method is broken down into into small incremental or sprints suitable for where requirements can change rapidly.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
 -the waterfall method emphasize on structured, sequential approach where each phase is of the project is completed before moving on to the next. this is useful where project requirements are well defined and project goals are clear. Often used in large scale projects where.while the agile model emphasizes on flexibility,collaboration,customer satisfaction and high quality software. It is characterized by short iterative cycles knows as sprints where each sprint is presented to the stakeholders this model is used where the requirements change frequently. Its generally used for projects with small teams where stakeholders require frequent communicationand feedback.Unlike the waterfall model where the requirements are fixed and don't change.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
 Requirement engineering is the process of determining user expectations and for a new modified product.This is important because it lays the foundation for all subsequent development activities which helps prevent scope creeping,ensuring project alignment and with business goals hence reducing risk of project failure.
 Requirement engineering is divided into several distinct phases:
     1. Feasibility study; this is phase assesses whether the project should proceed by examining the proposed system`s technical, economic,legal,operational and schedule feasibility.
     2. Requirement elicitation and analysis; this is phase involves gathering the requirements from various stake holders and analyzing the gathered requirements to detect conflicts,inconsistencies and ambiguities hence prioritizes requirements based on factors like feasibility, importance and risk.
     3.Software requirement specification;this phase involves documentation of the requirement in detail which serves as a reference for validation.
     4. software requirement validation; this phase involves checking the specifications for completeness and consistency to ensure that its done per stakeholders needs and are feasible. this done through reviews,inspections and prototyping.
     5. Requirement management; this phase involves managing the requirements as the project progresses by tracking changes , maintaining traceability and ensuring all changes are communicated to stakeholder.  
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is a design principle that involves breaking down a software into smaller manageable structures and interchangeable components called modules. This modules encapsulates specific parts of a system functionality enabling independent development ,testing and maintenance. 
    Modularity improves maintainability and scalability in several ways. 
     MAINTAINABILITY
       1. EASIER UNDERSTANDING: in a complex system broken down to modules  developers can create more logical and structured code base making it easier to understand and integrate the code.
       2. SIMPLIFIED UPDATES: changes can be made to specific modules without affecting the entire system.
       3.ERROR ISOLATION: when problem arise in a modular system, its easier to isolate the problem to a specific module making debugging and fixing more efficient. 
    SCALABILITY:
        1.REUSABILITY OF MODULES: well designed modules can be used across different parts of the system or in different projects. This reduces redundancy and development effort.
        2. INDEPENDENT SCALING: In modular system individual modules can be scaled based on the system need. This allows for more efficient use of resources and improves system ability to handle growth.
        3.FLEXIBILITY: Modularity provides the flexibilty to modify or add new features to the system without disrupting it. this makes it easier to adopt the system to to changing requirements or scale up as users base grows. 
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
 Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that the software application meets the specified requirements. it involves executing the software in a controlled environment to identify defects , ensure 
 quality and verify that the software behaves correctly under different environments. this process involves testing  on different level: ie
  1. UNIT TESTING: this involves testing modules in isolation to ensure they work properly. This ensures early detection of defects,simplifies debugging since tests are done on individual components and facilitates refactoring by providing a safety net that allows developers to refactor code without fear of introducing new bugs.
  2. Integration testing: This level of testing involves interaction between different modules that have been unit tested. This level detects interface issues arising from interaction of integrated components such as mismatch in data formats or incorrect APIs. It also ensure data is correctly passed between modulesand mitigates risk involved with module integration.
  3.   System testing: This level of testing the entire system is tested as a whole to ensure it meets the set requirements it focuses mainly on the end-end requirement. this level of testing ensures that the system as awhole meets the functionak abd non functional requirements,covers a wide range of test including user  interactions to system performance and security.
  4. ACCEPTANCE TESTING;  THIS IS THE FINAL TESTING LEVEL conducted to ensure that the system meets the user requirements and is ready for delivery. this stage of testing ensures that the software meets the business and user requirements,reduces risk of failure and facilitates final approval.
  
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version Control Systems are software tools that allow developers to manage and control the source code over time they allow for collaboration projects and tracks individual changes mainting a history of all versions.
